## 2. HTTP and REST
   - **Objective**: Learn about HTTP protocols and how they relate to REST principles.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style.
     - HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and when to use each.
     - Status codes: `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`.
   - **Professional Tip**: Always follow REST standards and HTTP status code conventions to make your API predictable and easier to consume.
   - **Example**: Implement a RESTful `GET` endpoint that returns a list of resources, handling pagination, sorting, and filtering.

## 3. ASP.NET Core Fundamentals
   - **Objective**: Understand the core features of ASP.NET Core such as middleware, dependency injection (DI), and routing.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Middleware pipeline for handling HTTP requests.
     - Dependency Injection (DI) for loosely coupled architecture.
     - Routing in controllers for organizing API endpoints.
   - **Professional Tip**: Structure your API into clean layers (Controller, Service, Repository) to ensure maintainability and scalability.
   - **Example**: Build a simple service-oriented architecture with controllers delegating business logic to services.

## 4. CRUD Operations
   - **Objective**: Master the implementation of CRUD operations for API resources.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - `POST` to create new resources.
     - `GET` to retrieve resources.
     - `PUT/PATCH` to update resources.
     - `DELETE` to remove resources.
   - **Professional Tip**: Use proper status codes for each operation (e.g., `201 Created` for successful POST) and implement validation to prevent invalid data from being processed.
   - **Example**: Create an API that manages a list of products with full CRUD functionality using Entity Framework Core.

## 5. Model Binding, Mapping, and Validation
   - **Objective**: Handle user input, map it to domain models, and validate it before processing.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Model binding to automatically map HTTP requests to method parameters.
     - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to decouple your API’s model from internal domain models.
     - FluentValidation or DataAnnotations for input validation.
   - **Professional Tip**: Implement strict input validation rules to prevent common API attacks such as SQL injection or over-posting.
   - **Example**: Use `AutoMapper` for model mapping and `FluentValidation` for complex validation scenarios.
